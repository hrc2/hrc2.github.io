Prof. Hoffman's proposal to study human and machine improvisation was selected as one of [three fully-funded projects]( https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/06/cornell-funds-projects-nyc-visioning-initiative) for Cornell's  New York City Visioning initiative.

A collaboration with music professor [Mianthi Paplexandri-Alexandri](http://marianthi.net), the project will extend the state-of-the-art in artificial intelligence and music improvisation and promote interdisciplinary conversations through improv workshops with the International Contemporary Ensemble and Theater in Manhattan, a course on improvisational sound machines, and public performances.
