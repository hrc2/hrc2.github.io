**TITLE:** Cornell Postdoc Position in Human-Robot Collaboration

**RESEARCH GROUP:** [HRC^2 Lab](https://hrc2.io)

**SUPERVISOR:** Prof. Guy Hoffman ([hoffman@cornell.edu](mailto://hoffman@cornell.edu))

**LOCATION:** Ithaca, NY, USA; remote option available for the near future

**TIMELINE:**

Starting date:  March 1st or as soon as possible thereafter; flexible.
Duration: One year, with possibility for extension to second year.

**DESCRIPTION:**

As part of a National Robotics Initiative (NRI) project on collaborative wearable robotics, we are seeking a postdoc interested in algorithms for fluent human-robot coordination. The project includes developing probabilistic inference and decision-making methods for robots that have the added uncertainty and safety considerations of being worn by a human. The research can be broader than just wearable robotics, and can include any theoretical, computational, and systems contribution related to human-robot coordination and collaboration.

**QUALIFICATIONS:**

- CS / MechE / ECE Ph.D with experience in AI for human-agent interaction and/or robotics, with preference for human-robot interaction
- Experience in [or keen interest to learn about] working on physical robotic systems
- Excellent writing skills
- Ability to work independently and make decisions
- Strong initiative and idea-generating approach
- Excited to tackle challenges and learning opportunities
- Professional communication skills

**RESPONSIBILITIES:**

You will be responsible for conducting high-quality computational HRI research (modeling, algorithm development, simulation, implementation on physical systems) leading to publication. You will also contribute to reports for funding agencies. If interested, there are opportunities to collaborate on research grant proposal writing.

**EXPECTED MENTORING OUTCOMES:**

You can expect to be supported and mentored in your research, presentation, and writing skills. You will have broad freedom to explore and pursue your own research interests or to focus on extending an existing research project at the lab. You can expect to be involved in paper reviews and program committees to help broaden your academic network.

**APPLICATION:**

Please send a short email to Prof. Hoffman with the following attachments.

- CV
- Link to list of publications
- Two representative publications (at least one journal paper)
- Contact information for two references (will be contacted after initial interview with candidate)

Please focus on the above items and do not spend time on formalities such as a cover letter, research statement, etc.

Feel free to contact Prof. Hoffman with any questions you may have en route to your application. You may also find it useful to contact any of his current or past research group members for more information.
