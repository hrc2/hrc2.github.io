# Abstract 

Combining high-performance, sensor-rich mobile
devices with simple, low-cost robotic platforms could accelerate
the adoption of personal robotics in real-world environments.
We present a case study of this “dumb robot, smart phone”
paradigm: a robotic speaker dock and music listening companion. The robot is designed to enhance a human’s listening
experience by providing social presence and embodied musical
performance. In its initial application, it generates segmentspecific, beat-synchronized gestures based on the song’s genre,
and maintains eye-contact with the user.
All of the robot’s computation, sensing, and high-level motion
control is performed on a smartphone, with the rest of the
robot’s parts handling mechanics and actuator bridging.
