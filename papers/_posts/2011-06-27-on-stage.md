# Abstract 

This paper suggests to turn to the performative arts
for insights that may help the fluent coordination and jointaction
timing of human-robot interaction (HRI). We argue that
theater acting and musical performance robotics could serve as
useful testbeds for the development and evaluation of action
coordination in robotics. We also offer two insights from theater
acting literature for HRI: the maintenance of continuous subsurface
processes that manifest in motor action, and an emphasis
on fast, inaccurate responsiveness using partial information and
priming in action selection.
