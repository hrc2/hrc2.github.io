# Abstract

We propose a method to integrate face-work, a common social ritual related to trust, into a decision-making agent that works collaboratively with a human. Face-work is a set of trust-building behaviors designed to "save face" or prevent others from "losing face." This paper describes the design of a decision-making process that explicitly considers face-work as part of its action selection. We also present a simulated robot arm deployed in an online environment that can be used to evaluate the proposed method.
