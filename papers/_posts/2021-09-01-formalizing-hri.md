# Abstract 

Robot capabilities are maturing across domains, from self-driving cars to bipeds to drones. As a result, robots will soon no longer be confined to safety-controlled industrial settings; instead, they will directly interact with the general public. The growing field of human-robot interaction (HRI) studies various aspects of this scenario, from social norms to collaborative manipulation to human-robot teaming, and more.
