# Abstract

We provide guidelines for planning, executing, analyzing, and reporting hypothesis-driven experiments in Human–Robot Interaction (HRI). The intended audience are researchers in the field of HRI who are not trained in empirical research but who are interested in conducting rigorous human-participant studies to support their research. Following the chronological order of research activities and grounded in updated research practices in psychological and behavioral sciences, this primer covers recommended methods and common pitfalls for defining research questions, identifying constructs and hypotheses, choosing appropriate study designs, operationalizing constructs as variables, planning and executing studies, sampling, choosing statistical tools for data analysis, and reporting results.
