In this work, we investigate the collaborative task of object handovers between a human and a robot. Object handovers are a central aspect of human-robot collaboration in both industrial and domestic environments. Tasks such as surgical assistance, housekeeping, rehabilitation assistance, eldercare, warehousing, and collaborative assembly require robots to give objects to humans and/or take objects from humans. Object handovers are challenging for robots as they involve coordination in both time and space of hand movements, grip forces, body postures, and non-verbal cues like gazes and pointing gestures. This project explores three research directions: First, we tackle the challenge of designing robot controllers to address various scenarios of human-robot handovers. Second, we investigate how can a robot use non-verbal cues to improve the human's experience and fluency of human-robot handovers. Third, we seek to provide new insights on human behavior and preferences in human-human and human-robot handovers.
