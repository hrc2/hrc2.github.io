ShadowSense is a low-tech, low-cost touch sensing method to recognize touch gestures and touch positions on social robots in the hope of improving the robot’s awareness and promoting intelligent interaction behaviors. 
A camera inside a robot’s body captures the shadows created by touching its skin, or even hovering over the skin, detecting both touch positions and social gestures.
