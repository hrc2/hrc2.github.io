The Collaborative Design project explores co-present and collaborative design space exploration between humans and robots.

**Collaborators: [Guy Hoffman](http://hrc2.io/people/guy-hoffman), [Matthew Law](http://hrc2.io/people/matthew-law), [Nikhil Dhawan](http://hrc2.io/people/nikhil-dhawan), [Amrit Kwatra](http://hrc2.io/people/amrit-kwatra).**

In design space exploration, the benefits of collaboration between human designers has been well studied. Intelligent agents, likewise, have long been relied upon as tools to search large or complex design spaces. Technology has arisen to support human designer collaboration, as well as to interweave human and algorithmic design search processes. Building on this, our work seeks to discover how embodied agents might work side by side with human designers to explore designs spaces together, e.g. through a shared physical interface. In the process, we investigate how and to what extent this kind of palpable human-machine collaboration can effect design processes, experiences, and outcomes.
